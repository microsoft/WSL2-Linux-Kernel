* ARM DMC-520 EDAC node

Required properties:
- compatible		: "brcm,dmc-520", "arm,dmc-520".
- reg			: Address range of the DMC-520 registers.
- interrupts		: DMC-520 interrupt numbers. The example below specifies
			  two interrupt lines for dram_ecc_errc_int and
			  dram_ecc_errd_int.
- interrupt-config	: This is an array of interrupt masks. For each of the
			  above interrupt line, add one interrupt mask element to
			  it. That is, there is a 1:1 mapping from each interrupt
			  line to an interrupt mask. An interrupt mask can represent
			  multiple interrupts being enabled. Refer to interrupt_control
			  register in DMC-520 TRM for interrupt mapping. In the example
			  below, the interrupt configuration enables dram_ecc_errc_int
			  and dram_ecc_errd_int. And each interrupt is connected to
			  a separate interrupt line.

Example:

dmc0: dmc@200000 {
	compatible = "brcm,dmc-520", "arm,dmc-520";
	reg = <0x200000 0x80000>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x349 0x4>, <0x0 0x34B 0x4>;
	interrupt-config = <0x4>, <0x8>;
};
